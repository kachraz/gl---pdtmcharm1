> Capturing the output of pdts command and seeing what manopulations that can be done with it

# Dev Notes

1. Parsing the output is beoming a littel difficult , need to rethink another way instead of parsing
2. Instead of parsing , just display the status directly and then you can just show a CLI you are building and let them choose, this will then remove the need to actually parse the output. Since parsing the output is not that much of a necessity at this point
